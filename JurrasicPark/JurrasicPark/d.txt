Dinosaur 1:
Name:      	Triceratops
Description:B
                Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on the skull, and 
                 its large four-legged body possessing similarities with the 
                 modern rhinoceros, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable 
                 of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It was also 
                 one of the largest, up to nine metres long and twelve tonnes 
                 in weight. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed 
                 upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that the two 
                 did battle in the manner often depicted in museum displays and 
                 popular images. The functions of the frills and three distinctive 
                 facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, 
                 these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. 
                 More recent interpretations find it probable that these features 
                 were primarily used in species identification, courtship and 
                 dominance display, much like the antlers and horns of modern 
                 species.
